A black, tar-like substance that is collected from rare magical trees deep underground. The sap is thick and sticky, with a bitter scent, and must be carefully applied to tools to avoid waste. Obsidian Sap acts as a conduit between the minerâ€™s tools and the stone, preventing the Bloodstone from becoming inert and ensuring its magical properties remain intact. If Bloodstone is harvested without the sap applied it will become inert, and its healing properties are vastly reduced.
