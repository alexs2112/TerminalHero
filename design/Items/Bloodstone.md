**Bloodstone** is a rare and highly sought-after gemstone with extraordinary healing properties. When applied to wounds, it accelerates the healing process, capable of regenerating flesh and curing ailments almost instantly. However, the stone's magic is fickleâ€”if it is not harvested with the proper magical grease, it loses its potency and becomes inert. Bloodstone is found only in certain pockets deep within the earth, making it a precious resource for those who can mine it. It is a key commodity for the **Auric Empire**, used to heal soldiers, maintain its power, and extend the lives of those in positions of great influence.
