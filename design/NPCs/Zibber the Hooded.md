The shop offers a selection of familiarsâ€”small, magical creatures that assist with various tasks such as skill checks or dialogue interactions. Zibber's origins remain shrouded in mystery, and while he is generally seen as eccentric, his magical knowledge is unmatched when it comes to the care and control of familiars.
