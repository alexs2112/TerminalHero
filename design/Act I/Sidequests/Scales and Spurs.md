### Intro
An import caravan from the [[Auric Empire]] has been attacked, its contents looted, and the wreckage set ablaze. Among the missing goods are critical supplies, including a shipment of [[Obsidian Sap]], a magical grease necessary to properly harvest [[Bloodstone]], and a strongbox of payment for previous Bloodstone exports. Upon arriving at the scene, the player meets [[Rangu, the Drifting Fang]], a lone lizardfolk tracker, who has been hunting down the bandits responsible.

Unbeknownst to the player, these bandits have ties to the [[Black-Pyre Syndicate]] and require the [[Obsidian Sap]] for further Bloodstone harvesting productions. This adds a personal element to Rangu's pursuit of the bandits.
### General Questline
- Setting: An import caravan from the [[Auric Empire]] has been ransacked and burned. The result is a pile of burnt debris and a handful of corpses of traders and caravan guards. The caravan contained a strongbox of payment for the previous Bloodstone export of the [[Mining Village of Arad]]. It also contained a shipment of [[Obsidian Sap]], a magical grease that can be applied to mining equipment to allow Bloodstone to retain its healing properties after being harvested.
1. When the player arrives on the scene they meet the Lizardfolk [[Rangu, the Drifting Fang]]. Essentially a lone ranger, Rangu had been tracking the bandit party responsible as they have ties to the [[Black-Pyre Syndicate]]. The player has both the option to **Investigate the Scene** and **Talk to Rangu**.
2. Investigate the Scene: The player notices a distinct symbol of a blackened-flame reaching high into the sky. A more detailed description of the scene can lay out some basic lore about [[Obsidian Sap]] and the relationship between Arad and the Auric Empire.
	1. Intelligence Check: The player knows about the [[Black-Pyre Syndicate]] and receives some lore about them
	2. Raccoon Familiar: Sniff out some hidden treasure that the bandits had missed
3. Talk to Rangu: Rangu introduces himself, says that he has been tracking these bandits for several days now. Offers his knowledge of the Bandit Camp to the player to team up.
	1. Rangu can join the player party at this point, if the player refuses they can find him outside of the Bandit Camp
	2. Dog Familiar: Rangu hints towards the horror he had witnessed of the razing of Narthos
4. This will enter a short dungeon sequence of fighting Bandits and Black-Pyre Soldiers. Given that we don't have those developed yet, we will have to return to this.
5. Once the dungeon is complete and the Obsidian Sap has been recovered, the player is tasked with returning to Elder Varik for the reward.
