### Intro
The peaceful cemetery outside the village has recently become the site of strange disturbances. Graves are being dug up overnight, with both the bodies and valuables within mysteriously disappearing. Only pieces of the corpses remain. Elder Varik tasks the player with investigating the cemetery to uncover the cause of these unnatural events.

Upon visiting the cemetery, the player discovers Patchwork Dead: decaying corpses reanimated through weak necromantic magic. These creatures are stumbling and misshapen, the result of hasty and poorly executed necromantic experiments. After dealing with these undead horrors, the player finds [[Gorren, The Grave-Touched]], a young and eager necromancer hiding in one of the crypts. Gorren admits that he unintentionally created the Patchwork Dead during his experiments, as heâ€™s still learning the craft of necromancy. His creations are imperfect, but he is more excited about his progress than the consequences.

After a second ambush of Patchwork Dead, Gorren, grateful for the player's help, asks to join their party in hopes of improving his necromantic skills.

**Objective**:
- Investigate the cemetery for signs of disturbance.
- Defeat the Patchwork Dead.
- Meet Gorren the Grave-Touched and learn the truth behind the undead.
- Defend against a second wave of Patchwork Dead.
- Decide whether to accept Gorren into your party.
### General Questline
- Setting: The cemetery outside of the village has been having issues. Graves are being dug up overnight and the bodies within are missing, leaving behind only bits and pieces of the corpse. The player is tasked with inspecting the area.
1. Investigation: Perhaps set this as a Dialog Tree. The player can inspect the area and they find the first party of Patchwork Dead. Corpses shambling around that are in various stages of decay, some are missing body parts and they stumble around clumsily. This adds the first encounter to the Area and the player can engage them in battle.
	- If the player has high enough Intelligence they will know that Undead are weak to Holy and Fire damage, while resistant to Dark, Cold, and healing from Poison.
	- If the player has the Black Cat familiar they will learn of a second party of patchwork dead milling around outside. This will prevent the second ambush and add new lines of dialogue. The player can choose to engage the second encounter in combat with or without Gorren. Maybe the cat is set out to keep watch and lure them away?
2. Defeating the Patchwork Dead: After the player defeats the zombies, they inspect the area and meet an NPC, [[Gorren, The Grave-Touched]], hiding within one of the crypts. After a short discussion, they are ambushed by some more Patchwork Dead and Gorren joins the party.
	- This is a forced encounter (player cannot leave the area) unless they had the Black Cat lure the second encounter away.
3. (optional) Once the second group of dead are defeated, Gorren asks to join the players party. The player can choose to leave him as a Necromancer, but can also select for him to be a Shadowblade or a Hexer. All dark-related classes.
	- Speaking to Gorren again is an optional task. If the player does not, they do not add him to the party. After the quest is complete, Gorren can be found at [[The Lifeblood Tavern]].
4. Afterwards, the player is simply tasked with returning to Elder Varik for the reward.
