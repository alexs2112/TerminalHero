### Introduction
The player is given this quest by [[Elder Varik]], who tells them that the Soulwarden, [[Gorren, The Grave-Touched]], has been missing for several days. It is not uncommon for Gorren to not be seen for several months, however it seems to be linked to the other troubles that the village is facing. Varik directs the player towards the Cemetery of Arad to see what has become of their Soulwarden.

 > [!Note]
> This unlocks the Cemetery for the player

### Cemetery, First-Stage
When the player arrives at the cemetery, it is originally fairly peaceful. There are only a few Patchwork Dead wandering about. If the player has additional party members, there will be additional enemies to balance it.

Goal: Reach the Eternal Church in the northeast of the cemetery. This will be the player's first meeting with [[Gorren, The Grave-Touched]]. Gorren tells the player about the Soulwarden profession, and that he had felt a dark call of necromantic energy to the cemetery. Witnessing the roaming undead, he came to the Eternal Church in order to conduct a ritual to banish them from the area. However, once he found his way inside, he discovered the [[Obsidian Lantern]] has been shattered, and he is unable to complete the ritual.

Encounters:
- 3 Patchwork Dead
- 2 Patchwork Dead

At the end of this conversation, Gorren feels another dark wave of Necromantic energy radiate around the church. The party is then attacked by a group of undead, this time with Gorren present in the party.

Encounter:
- 2 Patchwork Dead
- 1 Lanternbearer

After the attack, the player will speak with Gorren again (find a way to indicate this, or just force dialogue somehow). He will mention the importance of the [[Obsidian Lantern]] to warding off the undead, and say that there is an important [[Vaelthorne Crypt]] nearby that will probably have another Lantern. He will also note that the Crypt is locked and he has never been able to enter it beyond the entrance hall.

> [!Note]
> Once we have created some more classes, the player will be able to select the profession that Gorren will be for the rest of the game.

> [!Note]
> If the player has not already, this will unlock [[The Lifeblood Tavern]]

> [!Note]
> This will unlock the [[Vaelthorne Crypt]], however in order to venture beyond the entrance the player will need the [[Vaelthorne Seal]] which is hidden away at the [[Vaelthorne Shrine]]. The Shrine is not yet unlocked, and will need to be discovered by talking to either [[Elder Varik]] or [[Bartender Doran the Red]] once they escape the Cemetery

> [!Danger] Patchwork Dead
> Simple shambling corpses brought to life by the waves of necromantic energy. These 'creatures' consist of tattered and rotten body parts, some seemingly mismatched as though they had originally belonged to separate owners.
> Only has simple attacks

> [!Danger] Lanternbearer
> A skeletal figure clutching a rusted, glowing lantern that emits faint, necrotic light. It appears to guide the undead forces.
> Can provide buffs to the other Patchwork Dead
> Can deal dark damage to targets, restoring its armor
### Cemetery, Second-Stage
With the pulse of necromantic energy that Gorren felt, the enemies in the cemetery are then replaced by stronger, more versatile variants. The goal is for the party to clear these in order to exit the cemetery.
- When we flesh out how to prevent leaving and returning to dungeons, these enemies should not respawn or whatever when the player leaves the cemetery.

Encounters:
- 2 Patchwork Dead + Lanternbearer
- 3 Rotting Hounds

If the player has not already, they should be at least level 2 after they clear this section.
> [!Danger] Rotting Hounds
> Decayed canine corpses animated to guard the cemetery. They move faster than the shambling Patchwork Dead.
> Rabid Bite: Has a chance to Bleed
> Chilling Howl: Buff each Rotting Hound in the encounter
### The Lifeblood Tavern
Now that the player has unlocked the Tavern, there will be additional dialogue to ask either [[Bartender Doran the Red]] or [[Elder Varik]] about the [[Obsidian Lantern]]. Both of those NPCs will direct the player to go to the [[Vaelthorne Shrine]]

> [!Note]
> This unlocks the Vaelthorne Shrine
### The Vaelthorne Shrine
Once the player arrives at the Vaelthorne Shrine, there is a pillar of dark stone in the center and nothing else. The party will need to pass a basic skill check of any main stat in order to break the pillar. We will assume that the party will have enough of a stat by level 3. Once broken, this will start a boss fight with a Runebound Stalker enemy that will drop the [[Vaelthorne Seal]] required to enter the Cemetery.

> [!Danger] Runebound Stalker
> A cryptic, four-armed humanoid of the Astral Realm. Wrapped in broken runic chains that had kept it locked here. Its mask is engraved with the Vaelthorne Crest
> Astral Lightning: Deals Air damage to each party member
> Runic Chains: Deal damage and stun a character, reduce their AP by 2
> This enemy gains additional action points every turn
### The Vaelthorne Crypt
The crypt itself is a very short dungeon. There are only three rooms beyond the entrance hall, each room having a full encounter of moderately tough enemies. One direction takes you directly to the boss fight, the Unhallowed Guardian, while the other direction takes you to a treasure chest in a ritual room. This chest contains both Loot and the [[Obsidian Lantern]] required, while the boss drops some strong equipment for the party. The party is expected to be at level 3 for this dungeon.

When the Unhallowed Guardian is defeated, Gorren feels another dark wave of necromantic energy emanate from its corpse before it dissolves into a pile of Salt.

Encounters:
- Main Hall: 2 Bone Servitor, 1 Patchwork Dead
- Ritual Room: 2 Gravebound Watcher
- Boss Room: 1 Unhallowed Guardian, 1 Bone Servitor

> [!Note]
> The player should not be allowed to simply leave and re-enter the crypt without consequences.
> Enemies respawn if the boss has not been defeated?

> [!Danger] Bone Servitor
> A skeletal construct assembled with crude weapons and jagged bones, acting as a more offensive force.
> Bone Shield: Raises Armor for a time
> Multi-Attack: Attack twice (3 AP)

> [!Danger] Gravebound Watcher
> A towering, rotting figure with glowing eyes and remnants of priestly robes.
> Hollow Gaze: Deal Dark damage, reduce the target's Dark resistance
> Necrotic Chains: Bind the target, dealing Dark damage and stunning the target

> [!Danger] Unhallowed Guardian
> A massive undead knight, clad in ancient armor that bears the Vaelthorne Crest. Bound to the crypt to defend the Vaelthorne remains.
> Greatsword Slash: Deal physical damage to each party member
> Bone Shield: Increase armor
> Multi-Attack: Attack twice (3 AP)
> Soul Drain: Deal Dark damage to each party member, restoring Armor
> This creature gets bonus AP per turn

### Cemetery, Third-Stage
Once the player returns to the cemetery, all encounters will be replaced again by stronger and more versatile variants. It is expected that the party is of at least 3 characters and they are at least level 3, but ideally level 4.

> [!Note]
> The cemetery is now a Dungeon Instance, preventing the player from leaving without some sort of penalty.

The party will fight its way to the Eternal Church once more. Once inside, there will be another boss fight. Defeating this boss will allow Gorren to complete the ritual, ending the quest.

> [!Note]
> Once the ritual is complete, all encounters still active in the cemetery will end. This should probably reward the party a fraction of the XP that would be gained by defeating them in combat.

> [!Danger] The Soul-Tethered Herald
> The Soul-Tethered Herald is a twisted undead being that was once a priest or holy figure in life. In death, it has become a conduit for the endless waves of necromantic energy that have corrupted the cemetery.
> Necrotic Wave: Deal Dark damage to each player, reducing their Dark resistance for a time
> Unholy Summon: Summon a Patchwork Dead or Bone Servitor (3 AP). This grants the boss some armor
> Dark Tether: Deal Dark damage and stun the target
> Gains additional AP each turn

> [!Tip]
> Some loot and artifact equipment?
> Randomized loot
