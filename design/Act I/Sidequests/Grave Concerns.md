### Intro
The peaceful cemetery outside the village has recently become the site of strange disturbances. Graves are being dug up overnight, with both the bodies and valuables within mysteriously disappearing. Only pieces of the corpses remain. Elder Varik tasks the player with investigating the cemetery to uncover the cause of these unnatural events.

Upon visiting the cemetery, the player discovers Patchwork Dead: decaying corpses reanimated through weak necromantic magic. These creatures are stumbling and misshapen, the result of hasty and poorly executed necromantic experiments. After dealing with these undead horrors, the player finds [[Gorren, The Grave-Touched]], a young and eager necromancer hiding in one of the crypts. Gorren admits that he unintentionally created the Patchwork Dead during his experiments, as heâ€™s still learning the craft of necromancy. His creations are imperfect, but he is more excited about his progress than the consequences.

After a second ambush of Patchwork Dead, Gorren, grateful for the player's help, asks to join their party. Gorren reveals that he came to the cemetery because of the old [[Vaelthorne Crypt]] tied to the founding of Arad behind the [[Vaelthorne Family]]. It is teeming with residual necromantic energy, but he was never able to gain entry.

After Gorren leads the player to the Crypt, he reveals that it is locked and requires the [[Vaelthorne Seal]]. Knowledge of this seal can be found from [[Bartender Doran the Red]] of [[The Lifeblood Tavern]], who mentions that there are rumors of an old Shrine to the north of the village that was established by the [[Vaelthorne Family]].

### General Questline
- Setting: The cemetery outside of the village has been having issues. Graves are being dug up overnight and the bodies within are missing, leaving behind only bits and pieces of the corpse. The player is tasked with inspecting the area.

**Part 1**:
1. Investigation: Perhaps set this as a Dialog Tree. The player can inspect the area and they find the first party of Patchwork Dead. Corpses shambling around that are in various stages of decay, some are missing body parts and they stumble around clumsily. This adds the first encounter to the Area and the player can engage them in battle.
	- If the player has high enough Intelligence they will know that Undead are weak to Holy and Fire damage, while resistant to Dark, Cold, and healing from Poison.
	- If the player has the Black Cat familiar they will learn of a second party of patchwork dead milling around outside. This will prevent the second ambush and add new lines of dialogue. The player can choose to engage the second encounter in combat with or without Gorren. Maybe the cat is set out to keep watch and lure them away?
2. Defeating the Patchwork Dead: After the player defeats the zombies, they inspect the area and meet an NPC, [[Gorren, The Grave-Touched]], hiding within one of the crypts. After a short discussion, they are ambushed by some more Patchwork Dead and Gorren joins the party.
	- This is a forced encounter (player cannot leave the area) unless they had the Black Cat lure the second encounter away.
3. Once the second group of dead are defeated, Gorren asks to join the players party. If so, the player can choose to leave him as a Necromancer, but can also select for him to be a Shadowblade or a Hexer. All dark-related classes.
	- After this dialogue is complete, the player unlocks [[The Lifeblood Tavern]] if they haven't already
	- If the player does not or cannot accept Gorren into the party, they part ways and Gorren goes to [[The Lifeblood Tavern]]

**Part 2**:
1. Ask [[Bartender Doran the Red]] about the [[Vaelthorne Seal]]: If the player has not done so already, this is a good opportunity to explore the options that [[The Lifeblood Tavern]] gives them. Doran will tell the player about Rumors of the [[Vaelthorne Shrine]] and give some general lore about the [[Vaelthorne Family]].
	- Some additional ways to interact in this dialogue?
	- The player can also ask [[Elder Varik]] about the Crypt and the Seal, however Varik does not know much about the family beyond the basics. He directs them to the Tavern
	- This unlocks the [[Vaelthorne Shrine]] on the map
2. Visit the [[Vaelthorne Shrine]]: The player will have a simple skill-check when confronted by a shrine. Once they pass this check, they are confronted by a small mini-boss encounter. Defeating this mini-boss rewards the player with the [[Vaelthorne Seal]]
	1. It will require an important skill of a companion + 1, there shouldn't be any of the first companions or the player able to pass the check on their own at level 1
	2. Alternatively, every familiar type will have an option here
	3. This is so that you need to have leveled up at least once, with the Magical Menagerie as a failsafe

**Part 3**:
- No point in filling this out yet as we still have a long way to go with the game engine before we can get to this point.
