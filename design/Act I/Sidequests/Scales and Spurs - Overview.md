### Intro
An import caravan from the [[Auric Empire]] has been attacked, its contents looted, and the wreckage set ablaze. Among the missing goods are critical supplies, including a shipment of [[Obsidian Sap]], a magical grease necessary to properly harvest [[Bloodstone]], and a strongbox of payment for previous Bloodstone exports. Upon arriving at the scene, the player meets [[Rangu, the Drifting Fang]], a lone lizardfolk tracker, who has been hunting down the bandits responsible.

Unbeknownst to the player, these bandits have ties to the [[Black-Pyre Syndicate]] and require the [[Obsidian Sap]] for further Bloodstone harvesting productions. This adds a personal element to Rangu's pursuit of the bandits.
### General Questline
- Setting: An import caravan from the [[Auric Empire]] has been ransacked and burned. The result is a pile of burnt debris and a handful of corpses of traders and caravan guards. The caravan contained a strongbox of payment for the previous Bloodstone export of the [[Mining Village of Arad]]. It also contained a shipment of [[Obsidian Sap]], a magical grease that can be applied to mining equipment to allow Bloodstone to retain its healing properties after being harvested.
1. When the player arrives on the scene they meet the Lizardfolk [[Rangu, the Drifting Fang]]. Essentially a lone ranger, Rangu had been tracking the bandit party responsible as they have ties to the [[Black-Pyre Syndicate]]. The player has both the option to **Investigate the Scene** and **Talk to Rangu**.
2. Investigate the Scene: The player notices a distinct symbol of a blackened-flame reaching high into the sky. A more detailed description of the scene can lay out some basic lore about [[Obsidian Sap]] and the relationship between Arad and the Auric Empire.
	1. Intelligence Check: The player knows about the [[Black-Pyre Syndicate]] and receives some lore about them
	2. Raccoon Familiar: Sniff out some hidden treasure that the bandits had missed
3. Talk to Rangu: Rangu introduces himself, says that he has been tracking these bandits for several days now. He knows the general location for a small camp of theirs, however it would not be wise to attack right after they finished their raid. He invites you to return to [[The Lifeblood Tavern]] with him for a drink and a chat first. He knows that the Bandits have a bigger hideout that they stage their raids from but does not know where it is.

-> Go out to Bandit Camp, explore a larger outdoor instance (similar to the cemetery)
	- Somehow sneak up on the bandits?
		- If you succeed a stealth check, you get your choice of mapping the area, assassinating some guards, or?
-> One of the bandits survive, the player will capture and interrogate them
	- They is a larger, fortified camp deeper in the wilds
	- They were paid extra by the Black Pyre Syndicate (not explicitly, but Rangu knows this) to retrieve the strongbox of Obsidian Sap from the shipment
		- If you pass a check, you will learn that the bandits are hiding in an extensive underground section below the ruined watchtower
	- Searching the encampment will reveal a secondary cache of supplies with markings from a black market supplier
		- Rangu recognizes this mark and notes the location of a nearby Smuggler's Den
	- Rangu will give the player the bloodstone pouch if it isn't already unlocked
-> Smugglers Den: (optional)
	- A hidden cave network to the southwest of Arad
	- The largest dungeon so far, however one path is blocked off and can't be revisited until later in the game
	- This will provide a good amount of loot, money, and experience.
	- The player can defeat the boss, who will be reduced to 1 HP (he can't be reduced past 1 HP and combat will end)
		- The smuggler captain will provide some lore???
		- The player can choose to kill him or not. If they do not kill him he becomes an NPC merchant in the caves. Maybe there are some smuggler specific services he can provide (or just rare goods?). Killing him will grant some magical equipment.
-> Fortified Hideout: Stationed in a ruined watchtower in the wilderness
	- There is a small encounter outside of the tower that must be defeated
	- Once they are, a dungeon is unlocked of the underground section of the hideout. This is the bandit main encampment and will have 5 or 6 encounters within
	- Defeating the boss will reward the player with the strongbox of Obsidian Sap
	- Some lore implications of these bandits being hired by the Black Pyre??
-> Once the hideout is cleared, the quest is complete. Return the Obsidian Sap to the Foreman at the Bloodstone Mine (Elder Varik will direct you to him)
