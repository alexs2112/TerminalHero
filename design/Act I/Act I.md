### Introduction
The player arrives in the [[Mining Village of Arad]] to an abandoned scene. There are very few people milling about and the only one interested in the players arrival is [[Elder Varik]].

Upon speaking to the Elder, the player learns of a few troubles that the village is going through. Varik pleads for help and offers recompense as a colony of the [[Auric Empire]] along with whatever funds he can put together with the various crises that are afflicting the village.

At the end of each of these main sidequests, the player will be provided with a new companion that the player can add to their party. Each companion will be themed around one of the non-physical Damage Types and the player can acquire all 6 for full party versatility.

### Sidequests
Speaking to Elder Varik directly leads to several sidequests:
- [[Grave Concerns - Old]] - Providing [[Gorren, The Grave-Touched]] (Dark)
- [[Scales and Spurs - Overview]] - Providing [[Rangu, the Drifting Fang]] (Fire)

When talking to [[Bartender Doran the Red]] of [[The Lifeblood Tavern]], they can gain an additional two sidequests that each provide a companion.
- ??? (Cold)
- ??? (Air) (This one requires the player to have completed two sidequests already)

Once the player has completed two sidequests, they will receive a summons notification from [[Captain Elira Thornhelm]]. She will have an additional quest that provides a companion.
- ??? (Holy)

A final companion can be found after speaking to [[Zibber the Hooded]] of [[The Mystical Menagerie]].
- ??? (Poison)

Once the player has acquired a certain number of companions, different breakpoints will be reached that further the overall story or unlock things for the player to use.

Any additional companions will be left behind in [[The Lifeblood Tavern]], such that the player can reorganize their party when they need.

### Companion Breakpoints
- 1 Companion: [[The Lifeblood Tavern]] is unlocked
- 2 Companions and at least 1 Sidequest Completed: [[An Unexpected Summons]]. This will unlock a new place in the world called [[The Mystical Menagerie]].
- 3 Sidequests Completed: they gain an additional quest to return to Elder Varik. Thus ends Act 1 now that the player has access to a full party.
