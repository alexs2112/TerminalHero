# Overview
 - This village is used to mine Bloodstone, extremely valuable magical gemstones with healing properties.
 - The people are extremely poor and starvation is common.
 - Giant vermin are present as they feast on the corpses dumped outside of the village walls. 
 - Many soldiers and guards from the capital are stationed in a garrison here. Each month a shipment of bloodstone cargo is required to be sent to the capital
 - The soldiers only keep track of the mining work and the bloodstone shipments, otherwise the villagers are free to live and govern themselves.
 - The soldiers have access to [come up with cool name], creatures with the unique property to sense gemstones. They are used to ensure that nobody is trying to steal or smuggle bloodstone.

### Population
 - First Generation **Meldspawn**
 - Created through alchemical experiments by the capital, these creatures are amalgamations of human and animal traits (e.g., rat tails, mole claws). They were designed for mining but left to fend for themselves after being deemed failures.

# Sites of Interest
### 1. The Bloodstone Mine
 - The village is built around the remains of a Bloodstone meteorite that had struck the earth a long time ago. As it is, it completely encircles the mine of glowing gemstone that has plunged deep into the earth.
 - It's an unstable and treacherous place, prone to cave-ins and the occasional appearance of strange, magical creatures drawn to the Bloodstone.
 - The foreman is employed by the capital and is required to meet the monthly quota of Bloodstone. He has a set of armed militiamen for the day to day mining to keep watch over the workers

### 2. The Corpse Pile Outside the Walls
 - Just outside of the wooden palisade walls of the village, a pile of corpses grows with bodies of the shrinking population.
 - Burning the corpses with a fire astral stone could be a solution, however gemstones are relatively rare and expensive and not worth using on the issues of a small satellite mine.
 - A growing population of giant vermin feast on the bodies. They aren't a direct threat to the village as the capital guards make short work of them, however exploring outside of the village perimeter puts one at risk.
 - The player could find clues about the villagers' struggles by talking to those who mourn their dead or uncover personal belongings left behind.
 - A possible quest could involve dealing with a villager who believes that something far more sinister than vermin is consuming the bodies, possibly leading to uncovering dark secrets.

### 3. The Village Leaders Hut
 - Owned by the unofficial leader of the villagers, Elder Varik.
 - Taken on the responsibility of overseeing daily life in the village. They act as the village's informal governor, making decisions about what little supplies the village has and trying to meet the capitals monthly quota.
 - He is not brave, tries to stick with the status quo as it is keeping people somewhat alive. This will all come crumbling down when the village has their monthly stock of bloodstone stolen.

### 4. The Garrison
 - A heavily guarded compound outside of the city stationed by Capital soldiers
 - Only concerned with the mining and Bloodstone shipments, otherwise they do not care about the villagers well-being and don't seek to govern them directly
 - The player can potentially meet a soldier to then befriend or bribe to acquire astral gemstones to help solve some sidequests
	 - This could also lead to a sidequest to befriend a soldier

### 5. The Starvation Pit
 - A grim gathering place where families who can't afford to buy food come to collect leftovers or fight over meager rations. The pit is full of scavengers and desperate people.
 - A sick or injured villager might ask the player to smuggle some Bloodstone to them from the  mine to cure an otherwise fatal illness
