### Introduction
An import caravan from the [[Auric Empire]] has been attacked, its contents looted, and the wreckage set ablaze. Among the missing goods are critical supplies, including a shipment of [[Obsidian Sap]], a magical grease necessary to properly harvest [[Bloodstone]], and a strongbox of payment for previous Bloodstone exports. Upon arriving at the scene, the player meets [[Rangu, the Drifting Fang]], a lone lizardfolk tracker, who has been hunting down the bandits responsible.

> This unlocks the Caravan Wreckage for the player

### Caravan Wreckage
When the player arrives at the Caravan Wreckage site they will observe mass destruction and looting. Notably, some of the still-burning structures are burning with a Black Flame. The initial area will have two options:
- Search for Loot: An investigation check that will reveal some unlooted equipment and money
- Explore the Area: This will open into an outdoor area (pseudo dungeon) to look around the exploded wreckage. Two of the furthest back areas will contain some basic enemies to defeat (2 and 3). Once you do so, you will meet [[Rangu, the Drifting Fang]]
	- Main Wreckage: Starting Area
	- Raider Lookout: Rocks and Trees that the bandits could have hid behind before attacking, 2 Bandit Grunts are hanging out here
	- Road Turn: Another caravan that has been looted, 3 Bandit Grunts are still looting the remaining goods
	- Treeline: Where Rangu is, the trail of banditry ends here

> [!Danger] Bandit Grunt
> Left over bandit from the raiding party, left rummaging around and scavenging what remaining materials they can. They are low-level bandits, much preferring to stab people in the back than engage in combat.
> - Slow Attack
> - Quick Slash: Deal low damage but only (1 AP)
> - Bolster: Regain some armour (1 AP)

Talking to Rangu will provide some basic lore of the companion. Essentially a lone ranger, Rangu had been tracking the bandit party responsible as they have ties to the [[Black-Pyre Syndicate]].
- Asking about the Black-Pyre Syndicate will reveal basic info about them, that they are a large criminal organization that specializes in smuggling and protection rackets
- He knows the general location for a small camp of theirs, however it would not be wise to attack right after they finished their raid as their guard will be up. He invites you to return to [[The Lifeblood Tavern]] with him for a drink and a chat first. He knows that the Bandits have a bigger hideout that they stage their raids from but does not know where it is.

> [!Note]
> This unlocks the Lifeblood Tavern if it has not been unlocked already
### The Lifeblood Tavern (Optional)
- If you return to the Lifeblood Tavern immediately, Rangu will offer to buy the player a meal 
	- This shouldn't use the menu, just a dialogue option should suffice
	- Handle the case where the player has already eaten something
- Retrieve some more basic lore about the Black-Pyre Syndicate
	- They are notorious for setting their targets ablaze with black flame
	- They were originally a smuggling gang, that would take illegal Bloodstone to those in need and charge them extortionate prices. As their organization grew, so did their aspirations
		- This should be a very dramatic shift. Rangu does not know why, but it was very sudden.
		- This is due to the presence of the deity influencing the actions of the gang's leadership. Taking them from small-time smugglers to full on murderers and conspirators

### Bandit Camp
- This will be a somewhat larger dungeon instance (5 rooms). You will have two initial options:
	- Attempt to sneak in: A stealth check, succeeding will give you the choice of mapping the area or incapacitating some guards (potentially a third option)
		- Failing will add a combat encounter to the first room
	- Enter the Camp: Start the dungeon instance
- Now that there are 2 (or 3) members of the party, this will be more difficult than the original encounters. There are both bandits and Black-Flame elementals that the party will encounter.

**Encounters**:
- 1x Bandit Grunt, 1x Bandit Cutthroat (if stealth check is failed)
- 2x Bandit Grunt, 1x Bandit Raider
- 2x Bandit Cutthroat
- 1x Bandit Grunt, 1x Bandit Raider, 1x Lesser Black-Flame Elemental
- 1x Bandit Cutthroat, 1x Bandit Grunt, 1x Bandit Raider (bonus HP as "boss")

> [!Danger] Lesser Black-Flame Elemental
> Description
> Elemental Basic Attack
> Ignite: Fire damage, chance to set Burning

> [!Danger] Bandit Raider
> A bulky bandit with makeshift armor and a jagged club, standing their ground even when wounded.
> War Cry (bolster all enemies)
> Bolster
> Multi-Attack

> [!Danger] Bandit Cutthroat
> Multi-Attack
> Poisoned-Dagger: Causes weakness
> Reckless Attack: When armor is removed, deal extra damage but leaves self vulnerable

**Completion**:
- One of the bandits survive the players raid. The player will capture and interrogate them
	- There is a larger, fortified camp deeper in the wilds
		- Pass an insight check to learn that the bandits are hiding in an extensive underground section below the ruined watchtower
	- They were paid extra by some bigger criminal organization (The Black-Pyre Syndicate) to retrieve the strongbox of Obsidian Sap
- There will be a cache of supplies in the boss area with markings from a black market supplier
	- Dialogue, Rangu recognizes this mark and notes the location of a nearby Smuggler's Den
	- After the dialogue completes, the player gains whatever goods are in the cache
- Rangu will now give the player the Bloodstone Pouch if it is not already unlocked

> [!Note]
> This unlocks the Smuggler's Den

> [!Note]
> This unlocks the Black-Pyre Fort

> [!Note] Bloodstone Pouch
> This unlocks the Bloodstone Pouch if not already unlocked
