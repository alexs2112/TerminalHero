Each companion will have a damage type, and a choice of 3 classes. The player should be a class that is versatile in damage types and abilities so we don't get too many of one damage type.

### Fire
- Ashen Stalker: Ranger with fire attacks, Striker
	- Blinding Smoke: Blind the target, vastly reducing their accuracy (1 AP)
	- Flickering Flames: Light the target on fire, applying Burning
	- ???
- Wildfire Shaman: AOE combo control, Control Mage
	- Creeping Vines: Each enemy has a chance to become ensnared in vines, reducing their accuracy
	- Ignite: For each enemy with a valid status effect, end that effect and deal fire damage to them (vines)
- Inferno Knight: Fiery bruiser, likes a drawn out fight
	- Flaming Strike (?): Each consecutive attack with this deals more damage
	- Scorched Earth: Light the first 2 enemies on fire
	- Some sort of way to become tankier
