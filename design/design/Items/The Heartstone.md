### The Artifact of Narthos: The Heartstone
Long hidden away in a sacred temple within the village of Narthos, the Heartstone is a mystical artifact tied to the origins of **Bloodstone** itself. Said to have been created by an ancient order of sorcerers who discovered the potential of Bloodstone’s healing properties long before it was used for more mundane purposes. The Heartstone was infused with the raw essence of Bloodstone and, when used correctly, could exponentially enhance the healing power of the gemstone, allowing it to not only heal wounds but to regenerate life itself.

**Life-Extension**: The Heartstone had the ability to use Bloodstone as a conduit to extend the life of an individual indefinitely. It would draw from the Bloodstone’s healing properties and apply them in such a way that the user’s body would remain in a state of perpetual vitality, healing from any ailment, injury, or aging, as long as a consistent supply of Bloodstone was available.

The villagers of Narthos had kept the Heartstone hidden in their temple, a well-kept secret that they believed would be their protection from forces seeking to exploit the Bloodstone mines in the area. While the artifact was known to the elders and scholars of Narthos, it was kept from the common people to prevent its misuse.

### The Black-Pyre Syndicate
A key part of the [[Black-Pyre Syndicate]] and the storyline of [[Rangu, the Drifting Fang]], the Heartstone was stolen by the Black-Pyre as they razed the village of Narthos to the ground. They had originally learned of the artifact through their dealings of black-market Bloodstone and establishment of illegal trade routes. They saw the Heartstone as the ultimate prize, not just for its ability to enhance Bloodstone but for its promise of eternal life.

In order to secure the artifact, the **Black-Pyre Syndicate** not only ransacked the village but also executed a complete scorched-earth policy, burning it to the ground. They killed any witnesses to their operation and buried the village’s tracks in flames, leaving behind nothing but ashes. The Heartstone, however, was carefully taken from its resting place, hidden away by the Syndicate’s leaders for their own personal gain.

Rangu, who does not know of the existence of the Heartstone, was horrified by the brutality exhibited in Narthos, leaving the syndicate behind with a burning desire for vengeance against the leadership that had forced him to participate in such an atrocity.
