A pale, smooth gemstone with a dark, swirling core resembling [[Bloodstone]], encased in intricate golden filigree. Its surface is etched with faint runes that glow softly when exposed to Bloodstone-related magic. It can be used as a key to get past the entrance hall of the [[Vaelthorne Crypt]].

When equipped in the Trinket slot of a character, the seal grants 5% resistance to all elemental damage. Additionally, it heals the equipped character after each combat (otherwise the only source of healing is at the Tavern?)
