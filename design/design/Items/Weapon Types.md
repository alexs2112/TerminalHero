### Overview
Creatures get different combat abilities based on their current weapon + trinket. Each weapon will have a type, and each type comes with a default ability. Some unique weapons will come with bonus abilities.

### Axe
- Sweeping Blow: Hit each enemy for slightly less damage
### Hammer
- Crushing Blow: Hit the target and stun them
### Longsword
- Disarming Strike: Attacker gets reduced accuracy on their next attack (stun but worse? revise)
### Staff of Necromancy
- Drain Life: Deal dark damage to target, regenerate your shield by damage dealt
