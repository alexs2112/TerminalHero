Run by [[Bartender Doran the Red]], the tavern serves as a central hub for the player

**Description**
A modest but sturdy establishment, it serves as both a gathering place and a rare source of comfort for the village’s inhabitants. The tavern is dimly lit, with flickering lanterns casting long shadows across its rough-hewn wooden walls. The air smells faintly of iron, dust, and the hearty meals often served to miners and travelers alike. Inside, patrons can find a selection of simple, hearty drinks and food to help them unwind after a long day in the mines. The tavern’s name reflects the village’s reliance on **Bloodstone**, symbolizing the vital role the gem plays in sustaining both the local economy and the people. It is also the place where news and gossip from the outside world trickle in, often shared over the clink of tankards and the murmurs of weary miners.
