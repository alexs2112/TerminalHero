A small dungeon used as the final part for the starting quest [[Grave Concerns - Old]].

**Overview:**  
The Vaelthorne Crypt is an ancient burial site belonging to the [[Vaelthorne Family]], the imperial industrialists who first founded the [[Mining Village of Arad]]. Long abandoned, the crypt has since become a place of necromantic disturbance, its once-sacred halls now crawling with reanimated enemies and lingering dark energies. The crypt is locked and requires the [[Vaelthorne Seal]] to enter.

**Environmental Features:**
- **Deteriorating Architecture** – Crumbling stone walls, collapsed ceilings, and eroded statues of Vaelthorne ancestors.
- **Flickering Torchlight** – Some braziers still burn dimly with an unnatural blue flame, casting eerie shadows.
- **Residual Necromantic Energy** – The air is thick with an unsettling stillness, punctuated by distant whispers and shifting dust.
- **Bloodstone Inscriptions** – Faint glowing runes carved into sarcophagi and doorways, hinting at the family's past experiments.

**Key Locations:**
- **Entrance Hall:** A small antechamber filled with worn sarcophagi and shattered tombs, partially looted.
- **Main Hall:** A grand corridor lined with disfigured statues and rubble-strewn floors, leading deeper into the crypt.
- **Burial Chamber:** The final resting place of the Vaelthorne ancestors, now desecrated and in ruin, with a massive open sarcophagus at its center.
- **Ritual Room:** A hidden chamber containing two stagnant pools, once infused with Bloodstone magic, now inert and corrupted. A large **ancient chest** sits at the room’s end.
