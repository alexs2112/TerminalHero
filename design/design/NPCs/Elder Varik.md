Elder Varik is a seasoned and weathered leader of the **Mining Village of Arad**, carrying the weight of years spent overseeing the village’s struggles. He is an elderly man with a stooped posture, his face lined with deep wrinkles from years of hardship and toil. His eyes, though tired, still hold a glimmer of determination and wisdom. Varik has witnessed the rise and fall of the village’s fortunes, and now, as the village faces a series of crises, he remains the steadfast figure holding it together. Despite the village’s isolation and dwindling population, Varik’s concern for the well-being of his people and his desire to protect the valuable **Bloodstone** drives him to seek outside help, hoping to secure a better future for the mining colony.
