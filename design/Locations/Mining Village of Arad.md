Nestled at the edge of a rugged landscape, the Mining Village of Arad is a quiet, industrious outpost of the **Auric Empire**, dedicated to the extraction of precious **Bloodstone**. This rare gemstone holds remarkable healing properties, making it a critical resource for both the Empire’s military and its citizens. The village is small, with a sparse population mostly consisting of miners, laborers, and a few traders who rely on imported goods to sustain their meager lifestyle.

Arad’s primary focus is the mining operation, where Bloodstone is extracted and shipped to the Empire. A small garrison of imperial soldiers is stationed here to ensure the uninterrupted flow of resources and to safeguard the village from any outside interference or threats. Though it serves as a vital cog in the Empire’s medical industry, the village itself remains isolated and underdeveloped, with little outside contact, save for occasional caravans bringing much-needed supplies.
