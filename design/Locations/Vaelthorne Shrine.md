**Description**
Moss-covered statues of robed figures stand in solemn rows, their features worn smooth by time. Faded murals, depicting miners and alchemists working alongside one another, cling stubbornly to the crumbling walls. A stone path leads inward, guiding visitors toward the heart of the shrine where the Vaelthorne’s true purpose is hidden.

**The Shrine's Centerpiece – The Rune Pillar:**  
At the heart of the shrine stands a towering **pillar of dark stone**, its surface etched with faintly glowing runes that spiral upward in intricate patterns. The inscriptions pulse gently, flickering as though responding to an unseen force.

The [[Vaelthorne Seal]] rests within the Rune Pillar, and the player will have a variety of options to get inside of it.
