### Base Stats and their Interactions
- The primary stats are the four base damage stats
	- Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom
- These also increase the secondary stats
- Upon levelling up you can only choose to level one of the four primary stats, the others will be affected by this

**Strength**:
- Increase Endurance
- Increase Defense at certain breakpoints (or we increase all numbers to make gaining defense less impactful)

**Dexterity**:
- Increase Speed
- Increase Dodge
- Do we want this to also increase Stealth?? Maybe we could just remove Stealth and use Dexterity instead

**Intelligence**:
- Increase Will
- Increase Speed?
- Likewise, this should increase History checks

**Wisdom**:
- Increase Will
- Increase Defense?
- Likewise, this should increase Religion checks, maybe also Insight
