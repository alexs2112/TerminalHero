### Overview
- **Description**: Gorren is a wiry, pale-skinned young man who looks as though he hasn’t seen sunlight in years. His jet-black hair hangs in messy strands over his sharp, angular features, giving him a perpetually disheveled look. Dark circles under his piercing gray eyes suggest countless sleepless nights, spent either deep in thought or surrounded by the restless dead. A faint aura of cold seems to cling to him, as if the magic he wields has leeched warmth from his very being.
- **Personality:** Gorren’s personality is sharp and sarcastic, often leaning into the role of the "outsider" with an unapologetic edge. He speaks in a measured, quiet tone, with a penchant for dark humor that unsettles some and amuses others. Beneath his brooding demeanor, however, is a young man carrying the weight of his calling—a duty that both isolates and defines him. He feels deeply connected to the spirits of the dead, believing that his work is essential in maintaining balance, even if others dismiss him as morbid or strange.
