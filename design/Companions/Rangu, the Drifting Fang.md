### Overview
A lone ranger, wandering from town to town much like the player themselves. Rangu is fiercely opposed to the [[Black-Pyre Syndicate]]

**Motivations**:
- Redemption: Rangu had once been involved with the Black-Pyre Syndicate and had become trusted within their ranks. After being involved with the horrors of razing the village of Narthos in search of [[The Heartstone]], he left them behind, swearing vengeance on their leadership.

### Class: Gunslinger
**Mechanic**:
- Rangu begins with a set of ammunition, quantity is affected by the gun equipped (base gun should have 3?). This functions like a revolver, and will cycle through the loaded bullets until they are empty and need to reload.
	- Different types of bullets will empower different abilities
	- Basic Attack costs one bullet
	- Different bullets apply different effects to damage regardless of the ability used
- The base gun will only start with basic bullets, reloading will fill the clip with random bullets.
- Bullet Types:
	- Basic: Bonus 10% damage
	- Fire: Apply burning to targets hit
	- ???: Apply a status that reduces damage dealt
	- ???: Apply a status that increases damage taken
	- Armor-Piercing: Deal bonus damage to defense

**Starting Abilities**:
- Reload (1 AP, 1 Bullet): Empty the current clip and refill each slot with a random bullet.
- Smokeshot (2 AP, 1 Bullet): Shoot the target for low damage (DEX). Apply Blinded (reduced accuracy and speed). If Fire is used, deal extra damage.
- Double Shot (3 AP, 2 Bullets): Shoot the target twice for base damage. Apply bullet effects

**Future Abilities**:
- ?? (3 AP, X Bullets): Shoot each enemy in the encounter. Apply bullet effects
