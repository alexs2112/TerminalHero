A lone ranger, wandering from town to town much like the player themselves. Rangu is fiercely opposed to the [[Black-Pyre Syndicate]]

**Motivations**:
- Redemption: Rangu had once been involved with the Black-Pyre Syndicate and had become trusted within their ranks. After being involved with the horrors of razing the village of Narthos in search of [[The Heartstone]], he left them behind, swearing vengeance on their leadership.
