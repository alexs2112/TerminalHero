**Role**: Tanky support, essentially a Paladin

### Starting Stats
```
Strength: +1
Wisdom: +1
Endurance: +2
```

### Starting Abilities:
**Rallying Cry** (2 AP)
- Bolster each party member, scaling off of wisdom

**Enchant Weapon** (1 AP)
- Weapon strikes now deal bonus Holy Damage scaling off of wisdom
- This is good as this profession should split stats between Strength and Wisdom, to try to keep DPT with other classes

### Future Abilities
We need a way to let the player branch into like, Wisdom-based damage, Tanky with CC, or Support
